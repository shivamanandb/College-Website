    <h1><u>MASTER OF SCIENCE</u></h1></h1>
    <p>
        Full form of M.Sc is Master of Science (MSc). MSc is a two-year duration postgraduate degree course offered by universities and colleges in various specialised Science fields such as Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Botany, Biotechnology, Microbiology, Environmental Sciences, Food Sciences, Life Sciences, and so on.

A Master of Science degree provides scientific as well as professional entry-level competency to students. The course offers advanced theoretical as well as practical knowledge to students in their chosen specialisation. The MSc specialisation opted by students is usually the one studied by them during graduation.

If you are a graduate looking for career options in the field of Science, given below is everything-you-need-to-know about MSc in terms of its required skillset, basic eligibility criteria, course curriculum, top entrance exams, job profiles, etc.

Note: Apart from the aforementioned Science fields, MSc course is also offered by some colleges under Design and Hospitality streams. 
An MSc course is offered in a number of specialisations. Some of the popular MSc specialisations include Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology, Computer Science, Environmental Sciences, Biotechnology, Microbiology, Statistics, Life Sciences, and Food Sciences.

Course curriculum of an MSc course depends on the specialisation a candidate has chosen to pursue. Given below is an overview of subjects taught in some of the popular MSc specialisations
Research Scientist: A Research Scientist has the role of designing, undertaking and analysing information obtained from controlled lab-based experiments and investigations. As a Research Scientist a student can choose to work in a government lab, environmental organisation, etc... 
Junior Research Fellow: The job role of a Junior Research Fellow includes doing research, conducting research-related development activities, publishing scientific work and its results and so on. Along with JRF (Junior Research Fellowship), candidates are also usually involved pursuing a PhD programme.    
Mathematician: A mathematician uses advanced theories and techniques of Mathematics to develop and understand mathematical principles and solve real-world problems in business, government, engineering, social sciences, etc.    
Biochemist: A biochemist is a person who plays a key role in developing medicines to fight different diseases. As part of daily work, a biochemist analyses DNA, enzymes and other molecules to research the effects of drugs and food on biological processes.
Food & Drug Inspector: The main job of a food and drug inspector is to ensure that products are safe for human consumption. A food and drug inspector, also known as quality control inspector, examines food or pharmaceuticals at different stages of manufacturing process and ensures that quality standards are being met.
Chemical Analyst: A chemical analyst is a professional who collects information about the composition of chemical substances, and processes as well as communicates this information via the mediums of science, engineering and mathematics. Sometimes a chemical analyst also documents and publishes his/ her findings in industry journals.
Teacher: An MSc graduate can also choose to be a teacher in his/ her respective Science subject. However, for the same candidates need to pursue BEd after their post-graduation.
