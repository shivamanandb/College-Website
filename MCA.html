    <h1><u>MASTER OF COMPUTER APPLICATION</u></h1></h1>
    <p>
        The objective of this report is to propose a curriculum for the 3 year Master of Computer Applications (MCA) course. MCA course is now offered by more than 200 institutions all over India and is an important source of human resource for the software industry. The first MCA curriculum was proposed in 1982 and was later revised by a working group of the Indian Society of Technical Education in 1990. These curricula have been primarily used as guidelines by Universities which have their own Board of Studies whose responsibility is to draft curricula.  The All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), has one of its responsibilities specifying norms and standards for technical institutions. Needless to say a good curriculum is an essential requirement for ensuring quality of an academic programme. Thus the All India Board of Computer Science. Engg./Tech. and Applications constituted a committee which proposed a draft curriculum for the MCA degree. This draft was modified during a two day workshop held at Bangalore on 2nd and 3rd December 1996. In this report we give the modified curriculum.  Information Technology is growing rapidly. Increasing applications of computers in almost all areas of human endeavour has led to a vibrant industry with concurrent rapid change in technology. Thus the challenge in designing a curriculum is to identify the areas of core competence which is reasonably stable and provide sufficient number of electives and laboratories to accommodate changes. Thus the suggested curriculum has a strong laboratory and project orientation in which the use of new tools will be emphasised. Most courses will have an associated laboratory and it is expected that they will be equipped with the latest software tools.  One of the major problems. faced by ~most all colleges offering MCA ,course is the lack of adequate faculty. This problem has no easy solution as industry jobs are plentiful and very remunerative. This problem can be partially alleviated if good educational material is available to students and Staff covering the curriculum. It will be desirable for colleges to have internet connectivity as the net has plenty of educational material.  The infrastructure requirement for running the MCA course has been worked out by AICTE and a document has been published by them.  As the subject of information technology is changing very fast it is suggested that the curriculum be revised at least once in 3 years.
