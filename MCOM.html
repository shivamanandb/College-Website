There are about 3500 private, government and public-private MCom colleges in India which provide the course.
        MCom or Masters of Commerce is a two-year post-graduate level course ideal for candidates who wish to make a career in banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) as well as accounting and commerce sectors. The two-year course delves deeper into the functioning of the economy, capital, revenue, trade, taxes, etc. taught in B.Com. MCom is a very versatile course and gives the students to choose their careers in various fields.
