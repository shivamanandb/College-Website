        <font size="5px">Web development refers to the building, creating, and
            maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as
            web design, web publishing, web programming, and database
            management. It is the creation of an application that
            works over the internet i.e. websites.
    </p>

    <p>The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:
    <ol>
        <li>Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.</li>

        <li>Backend Development</li>
    </ol><br>
